## Current Election Issues:

 1. Illegal Voter registration and fake votes
 2. Problems in vote counting and EVM hacking
 3. Delay in Result
  ## Solution ( My Idea )
  Here i will try to explain above problems and how we can solve these problems using blockchain.
  
 1. **Illegal Voter registration and Fake votes -**  As we know fake registration is one of the issues in voting system. All voters can register on an online portal (For registration, voter needs to upload a government id and it will be verfied at the server end, only after that it will be added to the voting list). After registration, It will issue a private key using which voter can vote.
 **But here is a catch.** a candidate can pressurize voters to sell their private which will result in vote tampering. To remove this situation from the middle, the idea is to provide private key to voters at the time of voting only. this way vote tampering can not be made.
 
 2. **Problems in vote counting and EVM hacking -** In the post-voting period, the toughest task is to count votes and prevent EVM hacking. Using Blockchain Technology, After registration we can provide one digital coin to every voter. Using this coin only voter can vote. As a voter votes for a candiate this coin will be transferred to the candidate. And a smart contract can be added to maintain a list of candidates along with how much coin they received.  As this system will be built using Azure blockchain, votes won't be tampered or hacked.
 3.    **Delay in Result -** Nowadays it takes 2-3 days to announce the result of the election. Since there will be a smart contract to maintain a list of candidates along with their balance, result can be announced just after the voting is done. This will reduce the period of time to just next day.
 

## **Transperancy , Security and Accuracy**
As sole purpose of blockchain technology is to create transperancy and enhance security. This system will be built using blockchain and hence it will provide both.
Also since all process will be digitalised hence the margin of error will be minimized, hence it will lead to greater accuracy.
